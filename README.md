# DriveMyCarApp

## Overview
This project is currently in development and serves as the final project for the Computer Science course at Dorset College Dublin. The aim is to develop a mobile application that provides users with the convenience of requesting a driver/chauffeur to operate their own vehicles when they are unable to drive themselves. The app streamlines the process of finding a reliable driver, ensuring safe and convenient transportation for users.

## Functionalities

- User Registration and Profile Management: Users can easily create accounts and manage their profiles within the app.
- Requesting a Driver: Users can specify their current location, destination, and preferred pickup time to request a driver.
- Driver Matching: The app employs algorithms to match users with available drivers based on their location and availability.
- Payment Processing: Secure payment processing is integrated into the app, facilitating fare calculation, offering multiple payment options, and generating receipts for transactions.
- Driver Ratings and Reviews: After the ride, users have the opportunity to rate and provide feedback on the driver's performance, fostering accountability and trust within the community.

## Technologies Used

- Development Language: React Native/JavaScript
- Database: Firebase
